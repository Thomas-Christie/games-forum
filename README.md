# games-forum

This project is a games website I created as the second part of my GCSE Controlled Assessment. We were given an initial template for the website and I then implemented functionality allowing users to create an account, sign in to their account and create new threads and posts on the forum. Most of the code that I had to write for this project was in PHp, although I added a little in HTMl and CSS.
